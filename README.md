### Project Title
Github Project Submission for Python bikeshare_2

### Description
Use Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I created code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
